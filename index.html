Radiating beauty, like stars that shine.
Mustering the courage, I confess,
My love for you, in words, I profess.

Your smile, a sunbeam on a cloudy day,
In your presence, worries fade away.
Your laughter, a melody, sweet and pure,
In your arms, I've found my cure.

Each glance from you, a spell I'm under,
With you, life's a beautiful wonder.
In every part of you, a masterpiece,
My love for you will never cease.

So, here I stand, my heart laid bare,
To show you just how much I care.
In every part of you, my love does grow,
With every beat of my heart, this I want you to know.";
